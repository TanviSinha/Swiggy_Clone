# Swiggy-like Platform
This project implements a simplified version of a food discovery platform inspired by Swiggy, focusing on front-end functionality. It provides users with an interface to explore restaurants, cuisines, and menus, with a cart simulation feature. Static data is used to simulate menus, reviews, and other restaurant details, along with the user interaction features.

Project Features
1. Homepage
    The homepage displays:
      Featured restaurants using static data.
      Popular cuisines or categories.
      An attractive UI.
2. Cart Simulation
      The Add to Cart feature allows users to select menu items from the restaurant detail page.
      A service tracks selected items and calculates the total price in real time.
      A cart page displays the items added to the cart along with the total cost.
3. Static Data Management
     Restaurant details (name, cuisine, location, etc.) are stored in Angular services.
     Menu items are simulated for each restaurant using static data.
     Reviews are also simulated to show user feedback for each restaurant.
4. Routing
     The app uses Angular Router for navigation between pages:
      Homepage
      Restaurant Listings
      Restaurant Details
      Cart
5. Responsive Design
    The app is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
